    "# Model Building\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a continuation from the `Feature Engineering` notebook. In that exploration, we prepared a dataset for modelling by clearing out NaNs, binning continuous numeric features, and encoding categorical features. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our dataset consists of roughly 50k offenders and 750k offenses from the Correctional Service of Canada. According to reporting by Tom Cardoso of the Globe and Mail, reintegration potential scores are one of the most important factors in determining parole and early release for offenders. Reintegration potential is composed of a few component reports, but has a large qualitative and subjective component. According to Cardoso, the lack of cultural nuance in putting together these evaluations has led to racial bias in the corrections system. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will look at whether we can predict reintegration potential scores for offenders, and whether there's a racial component in determining scores. We will also look at any other features that are predictive of reintegration potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our features and target are as follows:\n",

    "    * **Multinomial Logistic Regression - OvR:** Baseline model.\n",

    "    * **Random Forest:** Usually more accurate than decision trees and doesn't tend to overfit. \n",
    "    * **SVM - OvO:** Effective for large sample sizes and uses a subset of training points in the decision function so it's memory efficient. \n",
    "    * **XGBoost:** Comparatively faster than other ensemble classifiers.\n",
    "* Test the accuracy score and ROC AUC for all classifiers to determine which is most promising.\n",
